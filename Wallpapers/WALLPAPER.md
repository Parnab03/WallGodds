# üìù Guidelines for Wallpaper Submission 

1. **Design Philosophy**  
   - Every wallpaper should align with the **minimalist aesthetic** of WallGodds.  
   - Keep it clean, inspiring, and user-focused.  
   - Use neutral tones, geometric patterns, or subtle gradients to fit the project's theme.

2. **Naming Convention**  
   - Name your file using the format:  
     ```
     [YourName]_[PullRequestNumber].jpg
     ```
     Example: `JaneDoe_101.jpg`  

3. **Folder Structure**  
   - Save your wallpapers in the `wallpapers/<Desktop/Tablet/Mobile>` folder.
   - If the folder is not already created, please create it. Categorize your wallpaper in the appropriate folder, such as Desktop, Tablet, or Mobile
   - Ensure the file format is **.jpg** or **.png** for consistency.  

4. **Documentation in WALLPAPER.md**  
   - Add your wallpaper details in the main `WALLPAPER.md` file under the "Wallpapers" section:  
     - **Title**: Name of your wallpaper.  
     - **Description**: A brief explanation of your inspiration and thought process.
